# SudokuSolver
inspired by "Coding with John".

Put the 9x9 Sudoku, you want to be solved, into "sudoku.txt".
If you run it without the file it will use the example sudoku board from John's tutorial.

Run the file with no arguments and it will just solve it.

You can put in 2 argument - works fine in Linux, not in Windows.

arg[0]:
0: just run and solve it
1: you will see statistics like actual row/column and actual number and the amount of moves. 
The delay - so you can see the computer "working" - is 10ms
You can change this with the second argument passing in.

arg[1]:
The delay-time in ms.
